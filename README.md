# Cracking the Coding Interview 

Cracking the Coding Interview is a book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell which covers the fundamentals of programming and to land that job.

## Why am I doing this

I have an internship to do soon, and I want to prepare myself with as much knowledge as possible in practicing and learning the best practices of nailing an interview.

## What I plan to learn

- Lookup over data structures and algorithms and ensure I know how every part of it works and how to work with trees, searching, sorting, tries, etc.
- Learn how I can write a professional CV and know what information I need to include.
- Prepare for the actual interview. Know what to say, what to explain, keep my cool, breeze through questions
- Practice the solutions and pushing them regularly. I should also look over them and make sure they're well written, commented, and includes the best practice
